Run the virtual machine!

Using the terminal, change directory to fullstack/vagrant (cd fullstack/vagrant),
then type vagrant up to launch your virtual machine.

Once it is up and running, type vagrant ssh to log into it.
 This will log your terminal in to the virtual machine, and you'll get
 a Linux shell prompt. When you want to log out, type exit at the shell prompt.
 To turn the virtual machine off (without deleting anything), type vagrant halt.
 If you do this, you'll need to run vagrant up again before you can log into it.
 Be sure to change to the /vagrant directory by typing cd /vagrant in order to
 share files between your home machine and the VM.
