 Leap_year algorithm in pseudocode
 ---------------------------------
 if (year is not exactly divisible by 4) then (it is a common year)
else if (year is not exactly divisible by 100) then (it is a leap year)
else if (year is not exactly divisible by 400) then (it is a common year)
else (it is a leap year)
